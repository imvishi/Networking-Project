# Networking-Project
Network Topology using Cisco Packet Tracker
## Cisco Packet Tracker
Cisco Packet Tracer is a network simulation program that allows us to experiment with network behavior and ask “what if” questions. 
Packet Tracer can be used to understand various concepts of networking with simulation, It can be used to design a network by connecting various networking devices and running various troubleshooting tests to check the connectivity and communication between different networking devices. Packet Tracer can be used to understand the use of different networking devices appropriately and the difference in their working. 

## Topology

In this Project, a network topology is designed and all the concept of routing and switching is used
